This is an isaac autosplitter for LiveSplit. 

Issues: 

* The starting delay is different when you start from the main menu compared to when you hold R. To work around this, you should always reset with R at least once when you start a run.
* It starts the timer 0.90 seconds before it should. You can account for this by setting your splits to start at -0.90 seconds.
* If you save+quit on B1 on your first character, it will think that's a reset.
* It splits at the end of the chest animation instead of the beginning. (pretty insignificant)

This is version 6 of the splitter, for afterbirth 1.06.0109
